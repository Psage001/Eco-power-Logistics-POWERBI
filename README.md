## Project Overview

This project involved creating a Power BI report for EcoPower Logistics to monitor various aspects of its business operations, including order processing, product sales, and customer interactions. The report pulls data from several sources and presents interactive visualizations that provide valuable business insights.

## Data Sources

The data used in this report comes from the company's internal databases, provided in Excel format, and includes the following sheets:
- Customers: Contains customer details.
- Order Details: Contains information about the products in each order.
- Orders: Contains information about the orders.
- Products: Contains product details.

## Report Usage

The report is divided into multiple pages, each focusing on a different aspect of the business:

### High-Level Metrics
This page provides a snapshot of the business's overall performance, including total sales, number of orders, and average order value.

### Order Monitoring
This page allows users to delve into order details, with visuals representing the number of orders over time and breakdowns by product and customer.

### Product Monitoring
This page focuses on product performance, with information on quantities sold, total sales, and rankings of the best-selling products.

### Customer Monitoring
This page offers insights into customer interactions, showing metrics like total orders and total sales per customer.

## Filters
Several filters are available for more granular analysis, including date range, customer, and product filters. These can be applied on different pages and visuals throughout the report.
